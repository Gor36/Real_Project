# E-commerce Customer Segmentation Project

## Introduction

In the realm of modern business, understanding customer behavior and strategically engaging with them are paramount for enhancing profitability. This project aims to perform customer segmentation through the utilization of machine learning, specifically by constructing a model based on customer purchasing activities. Additional objectives encompass exploratory data analysis, product and customer categorization, and the development of machine learning models for clustering.

## Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to harness machine learning techniques to create a robust customer clustering model, providing valuable insights for optimizing marketing strategies within an online retail company. The project also involves exploring the dataset, categorizing products and customers, and interpreting the results of the clustering models.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized originates from The UCI Machine Learning Repository and encompasses transactional information spanning from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011 for a UK-based online retail company.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and converting date formats.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Delving into key data characteristics, identifying patterns, and visualizing essential metrics.

3. **Product and Customer Categorization:** Defining product and customer categories based on purchasing behavior.

4. **Machine Learning:** Constructing multiple clustering models using machine learning algorithms such as KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN.

5. **Cluster Optimization:** Determining the optimal number of clusters using relevant metrics and interpreting the unique characteristics of each cluster.

6. **Customer Interest Prediction:** Designing a predictive model for customer interests and testing its efficacy on new data.

## Results

This project equips the company with actionable insights into diverse customer segments, aiding in the refinement of targeted marketing initiatives, optimization of product assortments, and enhancement of overall customer loyalty. Additionally, the developed model offers the capability to forecast customer interests, enabling the provision of personalized offerings.
